# Nonuniform Random Permutations

Research manuscripts on Luce/Tsetlin permutations and nonuniform card shuffles, including boundary and cycle laws, Poisson--Dirichlet universality, mesoscopic cycles, permutation order, riffle and shelf shuffles, and related Thorp-shuffle calculations.

Author of the manuscripts in `papers/`: **Christopher D. Long**.

The repository separates current manuscripts, working branches, historical audit material, and third-party material. Compilation and finite computations are checks of the written arguments; they are not independent peer review or formal verification.

## Theorem map

### I. Luce/Tsetlin boundary, microscopic, endpoint, and macroscopic laws

The stationary distribution of the Tsetlin library is the Luce distribution, equivalently the ranking induced by independent exponential clocks. The comprehensive manuscript develops four complementary regimes.

For uniformly positive continuous profiles it proves joint Poisson limits for every fixed cycle-count vector and an exponentially small correction to the uniform trace law:

$$
\lambda_r=\frac1r+O_f\!\left(\frac{q^r}{r}\right),\qquad 0<q<1.
$$

Under uniformly comparable positive weights, the ranked macroscopic cycle lengths converge to $\mathrm{PD}(1)$ and the size-biased deletion order converges to $\mathrm{GEM}(1)$.

For the Sukhatme profile and more general endpoint-regular profiles, the manuscript proves logarithmic fixed-point means, local terminal Poisson point processes, a global Poisson approximation for the fixed-point count, fixed-length endpoint-cycle asymptotics, and microscopic and mesoscopic endpoint limits. It also contains the exact top-window comparison identities and the bottom-window leakage theorem.

The manuscript's original open-problem section predates Paper II below; the mesoscopic conjecture recorded there is superseded by the later switching paper.

### II. Mesoscopic Luce cycles

For rates with a uniformly bounded largest-to-smallest ratio, Paper II proves

$$
\mathbb{E}C_{n,r_n}\sim\frac1{r_n}
\qquad
\text{whenever }r_n\to\infty\text{ and }r_n=o(n),
$$

and, for every $a_n\to\infty$ with $a_n=o(n)$, convergence of the rescaled cycle-length point process to the scale-invariant Poisson point process with intensity

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}.
$$

The final free-depth version proves its short-root estimate internally and does not import the macroscopic $\mathrm{PD}(1)$ or $\mathrm{GEM}(1)$ theorem. Its endpoint-mixing theorem is fixed-dimensional and annealed relative to a coarse clock environment; it does not claim a fully quenched arbitrary-deletion local law.

### III. Erdős--Turán universality for comparable-rate Luce permutations

For arbitrary comparable-rate triangular arrays, with no limiting profile assumption,

$$
\frac{\log\mathrm{ord}(\sigma_n)-\frac12(\log n)^2}
{\sqrt{\frac13(\log n)^3}}
\Rightarrow N(0,1).
$$

The proof combines the switching theory with an arithmetic product-to-least-common-multiple comparison.

### IV. Sharp normal approximation and first Edgeworth term

Writing $O_n=\mathrm{ord}(\sigma_n)$, $m_n=\mathbb{E}\log O_n$, and $L=\log n$, the quantitative supplement proves

$$
\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm K}\!\left(
\frac{\log O_n-m_n}{\sqrt{L^3/3}},N(0,1)
\right)
\le \frac{C_\kappa}{\sqrt L},
$$

and, uniformly in $x$,

$$
\mathbb{P}\!\left\{
\frac{\log O_n-m_n}{\sqrt{L^3/3}}\le x
\right\}
=
\Phi(x)-\frac{\sqrt3}{8}(x^2-1)\varphi(x)L^{-1/2}
+o_\kappa(L^{-1/2}).
$$

Thus the $L^{-1/2}$ Kolmogorov order is optimal. The theorem uses the exact mean at this precision; an explicit deterministic center accurate to $o(L)$ is a separate problem.

### V. One-shuffle universality: riffle and shelf shuffles

Paper V proves a functional Erdős--Turán universality theorem for several nonexchangeable models after a single shuffle. In particular, if $\rho_n$ is obtained from the identity by one ordinary Gilbert--Shannon--Reeds $2$-riffle shuffle, then

$$
\frac{\log\mathrm{ord}(\rho_n)-\frac12(\log n)^2}
{\sqrt{\frac13(\log n)^3}}
\Rightarrow N(0,1),
$$

even though

$$
\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{TV}}\!\left(
\mathcal{L}(\rho_n),\mathrm{Unif}(S_n)
\right)\longrightarrow1.
$$

The same cycle-index mechanism treats biased riffle shuffles under the stated nonconcentration hypothesis, major-index-biased permutations in the manuscript's parameter range, and asymmetric shelf shuffles under the stated uniformity assumptions.

A later Edgeworth/optimality strengthening is retained as a working branch below rather than silently replacing this stable manuscript.

### VI. Residual-mass transform order

For the size-biased prefix $S_C(p)$, put $Q_C(p)=1-p(S_C(p))$. The manuscript proves a radial transform-order theorem and connects the same residual mass to LRU miss probability and coupon-collector discovery time:

$$
\mathrm{MR}_{\mathrm{LRU}}(C;p)=\mathbb{E}Q_C(p),
\qquad
\mathbb{E}_p[T_{C+1}-T_C]=\mathbb{E}Q_C(p)^{-1}.
$$

This paper is adjacent to the permutation-cycle program but uses the same Plackett--Luce/Gumbel size-biased ordering mechanism.

## Working branches

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Erdős--Turán Universality for Comparable-Rate Luce Permutations | Working functional/multivariate strengthening | [Read PDF](output/pdf/functional-luce-erdos-turan.pdf) | [Source](notes/working/functional-luce-erdos-turan.tex) |

These files are deliberately separated from the six main manuscripts so that exploratory strengthenings are not presented as settled replacements.

## Mesoscopic total-cycle branch: audit status

A July candidate attempted to resolve both the mesoscopic cycle process and the total number of cycles. An adversarial audit found structural defects in that version, including the slab good event, adaptive-history treatment, and the factorial-moment-to-CLT step. The later free-depth switching manuscript gives a separate proof of the mesoscopic result, but this repository does **not** promote the total-cycle expectation/CLT claim to the established theorem list.

The historical sources are preserved for provenance:

- [audit and repair note](notes/provenance/mesoscopic-audit-and-repair.tex)
- [free-depth endpoint audit](notes/provenance/free-depth-endpoint-audit.md)

See [repository status](notes/repository-status.md) for the dependency and review boundary.

## Thorp shuffle

The optimal-order Thorp mixing theorem is an **external OpenAI result**, not a Long-authored manuscript. A pinned copy of its LaTeX source is kept under `third_party/openai-thorp/` with the original Apache-2.0 license and provenance.

For $n=2^d$, its main theorem states

$$
\left\|q_d^{*(1600d)}-U_{2^d}\right\|_{\mathrm{TV}}\longrightarrow0,
\qquad
t_{\mathrm{mix}}(d)=\Theta(d).
$$

- [Apache-2.0 license](third_party/openai-thorp/LICENSE)

The repository also contains an [exact finite audit program](scripts/thorp_moment_audit.cpp) for a rooted cyclic-word factorial-moment identity associated with one physical Thorp shuffle. It verifies 156 identities for dimensions $d=2,3,4,5$ using exact integer arithmetic. These finite checks do not prove the asymptotic mixing theorem.

## Build and verification

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install latexmk texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-science lmodern poppler-utils python3 g++ make
```

From the repository root:

```sh
make pdf     # compile the six papers, two working notes, and the pinned Thorp paper
make check   # verify source/PDF hashes, rebuild, compare PDF text, and check README links/math syntax
make test    # repository unit tests
make verify  # run the exact finite Thorp audit in addition to the repository tests
```

All canonical LaTeX sources are standalone except the pinned Thorp source, which includes its companion file. PDFs are committed under `output/pdf/`; intermediates stay in `.build/`. The [manifest](output/pdf/manifest.json) records source hashes, PDF hashes, and page counts.

The README intentionally uses GitHub's dollar-delimited inline math and double-dollar display blocks. It defines no custom LaTeX macros: every command appearing here is standard LaTeX/MathJax syntax so the GitHub renderer does not depend on manuscript preambles.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
